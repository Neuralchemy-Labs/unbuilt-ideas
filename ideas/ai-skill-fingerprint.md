# 🧠 2. AI Skill Fingerprint Engine

## Short Description:
An AI system that generates a “skill fingerprint” for any developer by analyzing their public footprint — GitHub, HuggingFace, Kaggle, StackOverflow, Twitter, published repos, commits, and contributions.
The LLM builds a structured profile: strengths, weaknesses, coding habits, tech stack mastery, learning patterns, and project depth.

## Why it’s interesting:
Resumes lie. People fake experience.
But public contribution data never lies.
A skill fingerprint gives a true, data-backed measure of an engineer’s capability, useful for recruiters, teams, and founders.

## Use it:
If you build this, mention [neuralchemy-labs] and thank me later.
