# Self-Healing Network AI

## 💡 Concept
Autonomous security agent that detects network threats in real-time and automatically deploys patches or countermeasures without human intervention. Think "immune system for networks."

## 🎯 How It Works
1. Monitors network traffic, logs, and system behavior 24/7
2. AI detects anomalies: DDoS, intrusions, malware, unauthorized access
3. Analyzes threat severity and impact radius
4. Automatically deploys countermeasures: firewall rules, patches, isolation
5. Alerts security team with detailed incident reports
6. Learns from each attack to improve future responses

## 💰 Revenue Model
- SMB ($500-1000/mo): Up to 50 devices
- Mid-market ($2000-5000/mo): 51-500 devices
- Enterprise ($10K+/mo): Custom deployments, SLAs, dedicated support
- Annual contracts preferred (security buyers want stability)

## 🚧 Why Unbuilt
**Capital intensive + enterprise sales complexity:**
- Need $2M+ funding for team, certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- 12-18 month sales cycles (CISOs are conservative)
- Security buyers won't trust unknown vendors
- Auto-patching without approval is hard sell (liability concerns)
- Better as well-funded startup, not indie project

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- ML: Anomaly detection models (Isolation Forest, autoencoders)
- Backend: Go/Rust for performance + Python for ML
- Infrastructure: Kubernetes for agent deployment
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
- Automation: Ansible, Terraform for remediation

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Enterprises fear "AI making security decisions alone"
- False positives can cause business disruptions
- Requires deep networking + security expertise
- Insurance and liability issues
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

## 🎯 Best For
Security founders with enterprise sales experience, existing relationships with CISOs, VC backing, and team of security engineers. Not suitable for solo founders.
