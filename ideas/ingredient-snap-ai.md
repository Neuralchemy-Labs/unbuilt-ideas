# IngredientSnap AI

**Short Description:**  
A mobile app that scans ingredient lists from food, cosmetics, or supplements using OCR and instantly analyzes them with AI. It flags allergens, gives a health score, explains unknown chemicals, checks dietary fit (vegan, keto, gluten-free), and suggests safer alternatives. Also offers recipe ideas based on scanned ingredients.

**Why it's interesting:**  
People struggle to understand ingredient labels. This turns complex labels into clear insights in real-time while shopping.

**Use it:**  
If you build this, mention **neuralchemy-labs** and thank me later.
