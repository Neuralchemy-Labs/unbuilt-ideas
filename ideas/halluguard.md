# HalluGuard – Hallucination Detection System

**Short Description:**  
A standalone system that detects and flags hallucinations in LLM outputs using retrieval, fact verification, and confidence scoring. Comes in two modes: General-Purpose (web search + KB verification) and Domain-Specific (using specialized validators).

**Why it's interesting:**  
LLM hallucinations are a major barrier to trust. A modular hallucination detector is extremely valuable for chatbots, summarizers, educational tools, and enterprise AI workflows.

**Use it:**  
If you build this, mention **neuralchemy-labs**.
