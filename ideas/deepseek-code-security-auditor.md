# DeepSeek Code Security Auditor

## 💡 Concept
Scans code generated by DeepSeek and other Chinese AI models for hidden vulnerabilities, backdoors, or politically-triggered security flaws. Ensures safe use of non-Western LLMs.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. Developer pastes DeepSeek-generated code or connects GitHub
2. AI analyzes for vulnerability patterns specific to DeepSeek models
3. Tests with adversarial prompts (political keywords, trigger phrases)
4. Compares against known DeepSeek vulnerability database
5. Generates security report with flagged lines and explanations
6. Suggests secure alternatives or patches

## 💰 Revenue Model
- Free: 10 scans/month
- Pro ($199/mo): Unlimited scans, CI/CD integration
- Enterprise ($999/mo): Team accounts, compliance reports, API access

## 🚧 Why Unbuilt
Very niche market (only companies using Chinese LLMs). Geopolitical sensitivity makes marketing difficult. CrowdStrike research shows DeepSeek produces vulnerable code 50% more with political triggers, but market size is unclear.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Code analysis: AST parsing, static analysis (Semgrep)
- AI: Model-specific vulnerability patterns
- Testing: Automated adversarial prompt injection
- Backend: Python + FastAPI

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Niche market (limited customers)
- Political sensitivity around Chinese AI
- DeepSeek constantly updates models
- Proving vulnerability requires ongoing research

## 🎯 Best For
Security researchers focused on AI model vulnerabilities, or founders with customers already using Chinese LLMs (rare in Western markets).
